(mouseover: "MESSAGE TO THE AUTHOR")[MYSTERIOUS, UNEMBODIED VOICE: "Pshh. Technically all fictional characters are unembodied. You know, it's a strange thing, this 'multi-linear narrative' stuff. It kind of shows that compatibilism the most realistic model, doesn't it? Like CUPCAKES.

Anyways, we know that the Fantasy RPG genre is full of tropes, so reversing/playing with them isn't all that clever. It's been done before. Also done before is this 'meta-commentary' nonsense. You do know that postmodernism is getting old, right? Everyone does it and thinks they're so smart, like they're the first to think of it. It's not funny anymore. Yeah, I get it: I'm a character that is written by the author yet is tired of his writing. Big deal. Once naturalized, unnatural narrators and metalepsis become trite, boring, and ultimately cringeworthy. So what do you want me to say, huh? How about I tell a story about ruining the word count. I must say there is nothing in this world I abominate worse, than to be interrupted in a story ]

[[Go back to the wizard.|The Good Ending]]

[[You feel like reading more about the story itself. How meta!|The Making Of]]
Creating MetaQuest was truly a learning experience. To begin, I had to know what I wanted to write about. The parameters were fairly wide: the story needed to be relevant in both topic and genre to our class. As a result, the topic I chose was ‘unnatural narration’, a theme that is made evident in my reversal of the classic fantasy text adventure genre. Also heavily relied upon is vertical metalepsis, as both the reader and author are placed directly into the text. As I wanted to lay bare the constructedness of the work, many references are made to the work itself, tropes within the fantasy genre, and the reader’s lack of agency. For example, every passage begins with a title, breaking immersion and signifying the fictional nature of the piece. 
	The layout of the story structure was fairly easy to figure out using Twine’s handy layout visualizations. As per the genre, I wanted to have one main ‘successful’ path in which the reader would be forced into playing the story once again. I say ‘playing’ as I have also included a number of alternate ‘failure’ paths which the reader may stumble upon. One of the choices regarding structure that had to be made was one of navigation. To reinforce the idea that readers were ‘trapped’ in the story, I decided to remove the navigational buttons that Twine includes by default with CSS. 
	
[[Go back to the wizard.|The Good Ending]]

[[Keep Reading.|Blah Blah Blah]] 
	
While readers may not realize it at first, MetaQuest relies heavily on the use of Harlowe’s pseudo-Javascript variables. This is the main reason the story was created with Twine rather than Scalar. I do not hesitate to state that the most difficult process in the creation of this project was understanding the logic in play. Keeping track of the three main items ($emerald, $vorpal_sword, and $debt_blade) was relatively simple as they were only ever TRUE or FALSE (the main exception being events that relied upon multiple items). However, other variables such as conversation trackers were much harder to comprehend. For example, visiting the bartender enough times will trigger a change in his dialogue, etc. Everything becomes further complicated as the story allows readers to return to earlier passages with their newfound items - as well as the fact that the story itself operates in a loop. 
	As per the genre, I tried to replicate the aesthetics of something akin to MS-DOS. It’s fair to say that this small feat would not be possible in Scalar. The font VT323 was obtained from Google Fonts and the Javascript module that replicated the typing of text (typed.js) was obtained for free on Github. Images labeled ‘for reuse with modification’ on Google were run through an image-to-ASCII converter on Text-image.com. As for the audio, a free audio clip of a computer starting up was obtained from Freesound.org and the music was taken from Youtube under the fair use exemption § 107.

The inky black hole shows no sign of accepting your weapon. There are no walls to it, as far as you can see. It is a vast oversight, an emptiness that extends beyond what can be comprehended. Nothing happens, which is not unexpected. 
At last, you are free from the accursed blade.

Without pausing to consider your actions, you do a sweep of the room for a cask of the most volatile alcohol. Just as you decide 'Volatile Alcohol' would make a great name for a band, you spot one casket leaking something green. It is labelled 'Wildfire'. You break the tap off with a quick kick, and put the torch to the viscous liquid oozing out of the casket. It lights with a 'whoomp', and, as if god had simply flipped a switch, your life is over.
Although you are not alive to witness it, the tavern explodes into a great firework of green flame, splinters, glass, stone, and body parts.
Through death, you have escaped the text adventure. If you are disheartened, consider the fact that you have cleared the basement of rats, just as the bartender had asked.

While the bartender does not catch you, a drunken man spots your criminal act and gives you a thumbs up. You manage to make it back down to the rat's cellar without incident, and place the wheel of cheese in the center of the room as an offering.

Although the rats did not acknowledge your gift, they did in fact remember. As you step out into the path, they swarm the streets with such a great quantity and fury that you could not move without stepping on one. Thousands of rats pounce upon the orc, tearing at his flesh as he flails. It doesn't take them long to bring him down, and in a matter of minutes they disappear once more. All that is left of the orc are bloody bones and a large emerald. You are not sure you wanted this.
